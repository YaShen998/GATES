This repository hosts the implementation of our several research works in Cost-aware Dynamic Workflow Scheduling:

1. *GATES: Cost-aware Dynamic Workflow Scheduling via Graph Attention Networks and Evolution Strategy,*  
  **To appear in IJCAI 2025.**

2. *Cost-Aware Dynamic Cloud Workflow Scheduling Using Self-attention and Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning,*
  **Awarded Best Paper at ICSOC 2024.**

Both works use the same simulator for policy learning, enhanced with distinct designs of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms.

## üì¶ Environment Setup

You can set up the environment using the following methods:

### Using Conda (Recommended)

```bash

conda env create -f environment.yml -n your-env-name

conda activate your_env_name

````

> Make sure your Python version is `>=3.8`.


## üöÄ Quick Start

1.  Run  the  main  program:

```bash

python main.py

```
2. Test the saved model:

```bash

python eval_rl.py

```

> To run the code in a server, you need to customize `train.py` or `eval_rl.py` to a service script.
> For multiple independent runs, `main.py` should use a different random seed everytime.


## üìä Example Output

After training and testing, results will be saved in the `logs/` directory, including total cost, SLA violations, and VM fees, which can be used for visualization and evaluation.
